# WebDevProject
This project is part of the Responsive Web Design course of the Highway to Code study module offered by Turku UAS.
The project is done as a group assignment between Mikael Korpela and Markus Orvasto.

The webpage created is meant to be a practice assignment viewed locally and will not be used for any other purposes.
